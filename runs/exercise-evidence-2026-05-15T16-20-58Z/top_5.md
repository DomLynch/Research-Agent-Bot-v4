# Top 5 interesting findings — exercise

**Snapshot:** 2026-05-15T16-20-58Z
**Source:** Researka DB Tier-2 search (`POST /api/v1/tier2/facts/search`, filter topic=exercise) — LLM-extracted, no Tier-1 canonical facts loaded for this topic yet; findings may be off-target (e.g. chemistry papers using the molecule name) until canonical curation.
**Facts inspected:** 38
**Ranking:** validation * magnitude * precision * recency (deterministic, no LLM). Same-paper + same-sub_topic findings are collapsed; extra biomarkers from the same trial appear as supporting numerics under the headline.

## #1 — score 75 · effect_size

**Finding:** tumor-bearing mice with access to running wheels showed reduced growth of MDA-MB-231 (-66%, P < 0.01) tumors

- **Value:** -66.0%
- **Population:** tumor-bearing mice (MDA-MB-231 xenograft)
- **Intervention:** voluntary running wheel exercise

  · DOI: `10.1158/0008-5472.can-16-3125`
- **Validator:** researka-tier2

- **Why it matters:** Direct evidence in the `effect_size` sub-topic; informs whether the finding generalises beyond a single study.
- **Caution:** Single trial / single subgroup (k=1 biomarker from one paper); replication across independent cohorts required.
- **Next question:** What sub-populations, doses, or timepoints remain underexplored for this finding?
