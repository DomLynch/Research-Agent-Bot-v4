# Top 5 interesting findings — exercise

**Snapshot:** 2026-05-16T18-12-38Z
**Source:** Researka DB Tier-2 search (`POST /api/v1/tier2/facts/search`, filter topic=exercise) — LLM-extracted, no Tier-1 canonical facts loaded for this topic yet; findings may be off-target (e.g. chemistry papers using the molecule name) until canonical curation.
**Facts inspected:** 37
**Ranking:** validation * magnitude * precision * recency (deterministic, no LLM), then one coherent broad theme is selected by aggregate score. Same-paper + same-sub_topic findings are collapsed; extra biomarkers from the same trial appear as supporting numerics under the headline.

**Selected theme:** `intervention_signal` (facet counts: clinical_outcome=6, model_context=2, molecular_mechanism=1, preclinical_cancer=1)

## #1 — score 90 · effect_size

**Finding:** Mortality risk was 11% lower (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.86-0.93; P<0.001) for every 1-MET increase in exercise capacity.

- **Value:** 0.89HR
- **Population:** male veterans with hypertension aged ≥70 years
- **Intervention:** exercise capacity (per 1-MET increase)
- **Alpha cues:** subgroup, functional_endpoint

  · DOI: `10.1161/hypertensionaha.114.03510`
- **Validator:** researka-tier2

- **Why it matters:** Direct evidence in the `effect_size` sub-topic; informs whether the finding generalises beyond a single study.
- **Caution:** Single trial / single subgroup (k=1 biomarker from one paper); replication across independent cohorts required.
- **Next question:** What sub-populations, doses, or timepoints remain underexplored for this finding?
